# Keyboard sounder

Hi friends! I made this app for my 2 y.o. son. He likes to play with a
keyboard and I thought it would be great if he could hear key names
and get some patterns (1 key = 1 sound).

It can be useful for adults as well to learn a new language
keyboard or to create your own keyboard
simulator based on this open source code.
