# Keyboard sounder

Hi friends! I made this app for my 2 y.o. son. He likes to play with a
keyboard and I thought it would be great if he could:

- press key button manually
- see this key popping up on the screen
- hear the key name
- get some patterns (1 key = 1 image = 1 sound).

It can be useful for adults as well to learn a new language
keyboard or to create your own keyboard
simulator based on this open source code.

## Help/contribution

Please, help me to record every key name sounds with a good voice and pure pronunciation.
